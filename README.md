# pocket
The framework that fits in your pocket

## setup
install dependencies:
```bash
yarn
```

## build
build a production build of the framework and example app
```bash
yarn build
```

## run
the prod server for the example app
after build
```bash
yarn start
```
then open [the todo-app](http://localhost:3000)

## develop
you will need to run `yarn build` once, then
```bash
yarn dev
```
after that the dev server will
watch all dirs and even re-render the example app when the framework is changed.
